# SQLParser

1. put “input.txt” and “AST.xml” into Project file Path
2. if you want to input other files of input. change the inputPath String in the Main.java

'''
String inputPath = "input.txt";
'''

3. the AST.xml will generated automatically in the Java Project file folder. So if want the output in other folder. Change the outputPath in the Main.java

'''
String outputPath = "AST.xml";
'''

4. The Main.java will not be generated automatically by javacc. So if you need to use the parser for other purpose, please read the Main.java File to modify the file as the way you need.

5. email gtx@iastae.edu if have any other questions regard this project.

Thanks
